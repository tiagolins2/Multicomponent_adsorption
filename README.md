# Multicomponent_adsorption

This code models adsorption of two gases onto an adsorbent, taking as input the adsorption data of individual gases on the same material.
Adsorption is a process where a molecule attaches to the surface of a material. It is very often applied for drying (silica gel), and could be used as an alternative 
to other more energy-intensive processes, thus being a greener option
